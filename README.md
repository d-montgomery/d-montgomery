### About Me

I develop high-performance computational tools for reactive flow, combustion, and energy applications.

Research areas include:

- Combustion and synthetic aviation turbine fuels (SATF)
- Carbon capture and energy systems  
- Multiphysics CFD  
- Liquid fuel property prediction  

### Featured Projects
